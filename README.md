# Atliq-Hardwares-Sales-Report
The project aimed to uncover valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. I employed a range of advanced Excel tools and techniques to transform raw data into actionable insights.

##ðŸŽ¯ Key Skills Demonstrated:
Data Cleaning & ETL: Cleaned and transformed the raw data, ensuring it was ready for analysis. Streamlined the data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes to maintain data integrity.
Data Modeling: Structured the data effectively for analysis, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in deriving insights.
Pivot Tables: Created dynamic pivot tables to explore different dimensions of the data, including product categories, sales regions, and time periods.
Advanced Excel Functions & DAX: Utilized functions such as VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS, and DAX formulas to perform complex calculations and data lookups.
Data Visualization: Designed charts and graphs to visually represent key findings, making the insights easy to interpret and share.

##ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes: 
This project significantly enhanced my ability to model and analyze large datasets, particularly in the context of hardware sales. I also developed a deeper understanding of how to extract meaningful insights from complex data, which can drive strategic decision-making.
